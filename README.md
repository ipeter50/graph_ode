### Abstract 

Reasoning about objects and relations comes naturally to humans.This makes sense, since this in many ways is how the world is struc-tured. We use this ability to make compositional models of the worldin order to make predictions. Common neural network architecturesdo not have the ability to reason about relations. A popular paperfrom ICML this year [1] introduces a framework for such relationalreasoning using graphs. Another well-received paper [2] introducesan intuitive framework for parameterizing ordinary differential equa-tions with neural networks. We argue that utilizing these frameworksin combination seems like a good way of learning e.g. physics di-rectly from data, and examine this in some detail.
